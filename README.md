# My first project:

## Purpose:
This project is the beginning of my journey. Here, I have applied some intermediate level techniques that I learned using Python. This project shows the exploratory analysis I performed to reach at the solution.

## Project Introduction:
Here, I have taken a dataset containing information about movies released on Netflix along with the movie related data such as, title, genre, release year, IMDB rating, etc. The problem statement or the question is, "Look in to the data and find if there is a decrease in the duration of movies that are being produced recently". Meaning, there is a lot of information regarding various shows released on Netflix, out of those we are only interested in Movie type. We then will look into the resons which may have an impact on the duration of the movies and the result will help us find the solution to the problem statement.

## Data modifications:
For the exploratory analysis to be performed well using Python, I took some efforts to clean the data in excel and then the data is imported into the Jupyter notebook. Being a begineer I first performed some basic operations using Lists and Dictioneries in first 4 steps. The actual exploratory analysis starts after that.

### The " [first_project (1).ipynb](https://github.com/nikhilkhawase/NIKhil_khawase_projects/blob/main/first_project%20(1).ipynb) " 
this file is the Jupyter notebook in which the exploratory analysis has been performed.
### The " [Netflix Dataset Latest 2021](https://github.com/nikhilkhawase/NIKhil_khawase_projects/blob/main/Netflix%20Dataset%20Latest%202021.xlsx) " 
this file contens the actual data that I took into consideration for the project.
### The " [netflix_data_cleaned](https://github.com/nikhilkhawase/NIKhil_khawase_projects/blob/main/netflix_data_cleaned.csv) " 
this file contens the data after the cleaning process performe on the " Netflix Dataset Latest 2021 " using excel.

## Sources:
### Project source: Datacamp 
This project was a guided project which is a part of a part of the Python course track I followed.

### Data source: Kaggle:
The data source has been imported from Kaggle.
